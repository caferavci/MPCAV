## Motivation

The objective of this research is to develop and test a trajectory optimisation strategy for platoons of CACC-equipped vehicles that is:

* able to optimise trajectories cooperatively for all vehicles in a platoon, by considering vehicle dynamics based on state-of-the-art CACC models, including also desired system-level objectives;

* robust not only in fully automated environment but also in mixed vehicle traffic environment;

* able to work on-line in different traffic conditions

* able to adapt headway to optimal macroscobic headway obtained from upper-level optimization layer.
